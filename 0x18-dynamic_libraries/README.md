This is a file containing solutions to dynamic libraries tasks.
A dynamic library is a programming concept in which shared libraries with special functionalities are launched only during program execution, which minimizes overall program size and facilitates improved application performance for reduced memory consumption. In most software programs, distributing specific functionalities into distinct modules allows loading as needed.
A dynamic library is never part of an executable file or application. During runtime, a link is established between a dynamic library and executable file or application.
